# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains style guides specifically designed for AI editing and writing projects. These guides provide structured rules and best practices that AI systems can use to maintain consistency and quality in content creation.

## Purpose and Usage

The style guides in this repository are meant to be:
- Used as reference material for AI-assisted writing tasks
- Incorporated into AI prompts for consistent output
- Applied as formatting rules for AI-generated content

## Current Content

- `Gute Praesentation.md` - Comprehensive presentation guidelines (German)
- `README.md` - Repository overview and usage instructions (English)

## Working with Style Guides

When editing or adding style guides:
1. Write clear, unambiguous rules that AI systems can interpret
2. Maintain the structured format used in existing guides
3. Consider how AI systems will parse and apply the guidelines
4. Include practical examples where applicable

## Language Considerations

- Individual guides may be in different languages (currently German and English)
- When editing German documents, maintain consistency with German language conventions
- The README.md should remain in English as the primary documentation

## No Build or Test Commands

This is a pure documentation repository with no code, build scripts, or tests to run.

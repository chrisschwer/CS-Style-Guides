- `interaktionsmuster.md` - User flows, copy-buttons, download functionality
- `website-content.md` - All German website texts and copy
- `assets/` - Screenshots, mockups, icons for website development

### ðŸ’» Website Code/
**Purpose**: Technical implementation of the website
**Structure**:
- `planning/` - Technical architecture and development plans
- `documentation/` - Developer guides and deployment instructions
- `ki-styleguides-website/` - Astro-based website (functional prototype ready)

## Working with Different Areas

### Content Updates (Styleguides/)
- All style guides are in German and follow consistent formatting
- Each guide has frontmatter with metadata (title, description, category)
- Include practical examples and clear rules that AI systems can interpret
- Test guides with actual AI tools before finalizing

### Design Work (Website Design/)
- Design follows mobile-first, accessibility-focused principles
- Color palette: Primary blue (#1e40af), accent green (#059669)
- Typography: Inter for text, JetBrains Mono for code
- All wireframes are detailed with exact measurements and responsive behavior

### Website Development (Website Code/)
- Tech stack: Astro + Tailwind CSS for optimal performance
- Static site generation for fast loading and SEO
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy AI integration
- Deployment target: Netlify/Vercel with automatic builds

## Development Commands

### For Website Development
```bash
cd "Website Code/ki-styleguides-website"

# Install dependencies (first time)
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### For Content Updates
- Edit files directly in `Styleguides/` folder
- No build process required for style guides
- Test with AI tools before committing changes

## Key Principles

### Content Creation
1. **AI-First Design**: All guides must work well when copied into AI prompts
2. **German Focus**: All style guides target German language writing
3. **Practical Examples**: Include before/after examples, not just rules
4. **Structured Format**: Consistent headings and organization across guides

### Website Development  
1. **Performance**: < 2 second load times, Lighthouse score > 90
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation
3. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile experience
4. **User-Friendly**: One-click downloads, copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Collaboration
- **Styleguides/**: Content creators and AI specialists
- **Website Design/**: UX/UI designers and content strategists  
- **Website Code/**: Frontend developers and DevOps

## License and Usage

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Style Guide
1. Create new .md file in `Styleguides/`
2. Follow existing format and structure
3. Update `Styleguides/README.md` with new guide
4. Add corresponding content to `Website Design/website-content.md`
5. Test with AI tools before publishing

### Updating Website Design
1. Modify files in `Website Design/` 
2. Ensure wireframes match content changes
3. Update `website-content.md` if copy changes
4. Coordinate with development team for implementation

### Website Deployment
1. Work in `Website Code/ki-styleguides-website/`
2. Styleguides are automatically copied to `public/files/` for downloads
3. Current status: Functional prototype with homepage and downloads page
4. Ready for deployment to Netlify/Vercel
5. Test with `npm run build && npm run preview` before deployment

This structure supports both independent work on different aspects and coordinated development of the complete website experience.

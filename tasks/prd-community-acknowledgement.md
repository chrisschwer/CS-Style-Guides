# Product Requirements Document: Community Acknowledgement Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Community Acknowledgement feature will automatically display and recognize all contributors to the CS Style Guides project on the website's "Über" (About) page. This feature addresses the need to give proper credit to everyone who has contributed to the project, as it is simply fair to acknowledge their efforts. The feature will automatically pull contributor information from GitHub and display it in a visually appealing format that matches the existing website design.

## Goals

1. Provide proper credit and recognition to all project contributors
2. Create a fair and transparent acknowledgement system
3. Automate the contributor recognition process to ensure it stays current
4. Maintain consistency with the existing website design language
5. Respect contributor privacy through opt-out functionality

## User Stories

1. **As a website visitor**, I want to see who contributed to this project so I can understand the community behind it and the collaborative nature of the work.

2. **As a contributor**, I want my contributions recognized so I feel valued and appropriately credited for my work on the project.

3. **As a project maintainer**, I want contributor recognition to be automated so it stays current without manual maintenance.

4. **As a privacy-conscious contributor**, I want the ability to opt-out of public recognition if I prefer not to be displayed.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must automatically fetch contributor data from the GitHub repository API during website builds.

2. The system must display contributor information in a new "Contributors" section on the "Über" page.

3. The system must show contributor avatars and names/usernames for visual recognition.

4. The system must NOT display contribution statistics (commits, lines of code, etc.).

5. The system must include all types of contributors (code, documentation, design, etc.) as recognized by GitHub.

6. The system must provide an opt-out mechanism through GitHub issues, repository files, or manual additions to an exclusion file.

7. The system must handle API failures gracefully (fallback to cached data or hide section).

8. The system must implement a 24-hour caching mechanism to limit API calls to maximum once per day.

9. The system must display contributors ordered by their first contribution date (earliest contributors first).

10. The system must use the GitHub logo as fallback for contributors without profile pictures.

11. The system must follow the existing website design language and styling patterns.

12. The system must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Contribution Statistics**: No display of commit counts, lines changed, or other quantitative metrics
2. **Manual Contributor Management**: No manual addition/removal of contributors outside of GitHub
3. **Contribution History**: No timeline or historical contribution tracking
4. **External Platform Integration**: Only GitHub contributors, not contributors from other platforms
5. **Detailed Contribution Types**: No breakdown of what type of contributions each person made
6. **Success Metrics Tracking**: No analytics or success measurement implementation

## Design Considerations

1. **Visual Design**: Must integrate seamlessly with the existing Astro + Tailwind CSS design system
2. **Layout**: Should appear as a dedicated "Contributors" section on the "Über" page
3. **Avatar Display**: Use GitHub profile pictures in a grid or list format
4. **Typography**: Follow existing font choices (Inter for text)
5. **Spacing**: Maintain consistent spacing and margins with other page sections
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure proper display on all device sizes
7. **Loading States**: Include appropriate loading indicators while fetching data

## Technical Considerations

1. **GitHub API Integration**: Use GitHub's REST API v3 or GraphQL API v4 for fetching the default contributors list
2. **Build-Time Generation**: Fetch contributor data during the Astro build process for static generation
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement 24-hour caching - fetch on every build but use cached data if last fetch was within 24 hours
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable or rate limited
5. **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Support multiple opt-out methods - GitHub issues, repository files, or manual additions to exclusion file
6. **Contributor Ordering**: Sort contributors by first contribution date (earliest first) using GitHub API data
7. **Avatar Fallbacks**: Use GitHub logo for contributors without profile pictures
8. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with GitHub's terms of service and privacy policies
9. **Performance**: Optimize image loading for contributor avatars (lazy loading, appropriate sizing)

## Success Metrics

No specific success metrics will be tracked for this feature. The implementation success will be determined by the proper display and recognition of contributors as intended.

## Implementation Details

Based on clarifications, the following implementation decisions have been made:

1. **Opt-Out Implementation**: Support multiple methods - GitHub issues, repository files, or manual additions to an exclusion file for maximum flexibility

2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement 24-hour caching - fetch on every build but use cached data if the last successful fetch was within 24 hours

3. **Contributor Definition**: Use GitHub's default contributor list as provided by the contributors API endpoint

4. **Display Order**: Contributors will be ordered by their first contribution date, with earliest contributors displayed first

5. **Avatar Fallbacks**: Use the GitHub logo for contributors who don't have profile pictures

6. **Update Frequency**: Fetch contributor data on every build, but respect 24-hour caching to limit API calls to maximum once per day
